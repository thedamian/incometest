# Income Test

There are too many people that feel what they make is too low and that everyone else makes more. And frankly I think they're wrong. And there's only one way we can find out the truth. Trust the data!

## Where is this information from.
I'm using the IRS's 2022 "SOI tax stats - Individual statistical tables by size of adjusted gross income"

What I do is take the amount you tell me. then using the 2022 data (which is the lastest) I add all the people that make LESS than you and show you and then say that you are a certain percentage of income earners compared to the total number of reported individuals that make the same amount or less than you and divide that by the total number of reported adjusted income.
